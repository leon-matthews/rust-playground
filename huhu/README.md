# Huhu Log Exploration

Re-implementation of my Python project to explore Apache Webserver logs files.

Rust has the distinction of having the fastest regex library on the planet; it
will be interesting to see how this goes.


## MVP

- Read all lines from a single log file
- Match hostnames using regex and map those to their counts
