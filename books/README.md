# Rust Books

These are example programs I typed in while reading the named book. They are
either from the books directly, or created by me to explore the idea being
described.

If any of the crates differ enough from the book version to become interesting
in their own right, they'll be promoted up out of their *books* folder.

BTW, reading about the same topic from different authors is a great way to really
understand a difficult topic, Rust's ownership rules for example.
