## A Project-Based Primer for Writing Rust CLIs

## Currently

Just finished *catr* example program and got all tests to pass.

Had to manually upgrade from using v1 of the *clap* library, as used in the
book, to the currently supported version 4.

## Next

Start the *headr* project from Chapter 4.

In the last project we used *clap* and its *derive* API to parse the
command-line arguments. This time I might try using the manual, *builder* API
instead. I should at least try both.
