## Fast, Save Systems Development

*Jim Blandy, Jason Orendorff, and Leonora F. S. Tindall*

## Resources

* [Code examples](https://github.com/ProgrammingRust)


## Currently

Work through example code in Chapter 3, *Fundamental Types*.


## Next

Work through example code in Chapter 4, *Owership*.


## Sometime

Re-read Mandlebrot example from Chapter 2 with fresh eyes to see how much
more I understand now - and with a view to eventually refactor to use a thread
pool and much smaller chunks of work (one row per thread invocation?).
