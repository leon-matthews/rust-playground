*Jim Blandy, Jason Orendorff, and Leonora F. S. Tindall*

## Resources

* [Code examples](https://github.com/ProgrammingRust)


## Currently

Write sample code from Chapter 18, *Input and Output*.


## Next

Benchmark various methods of reading and writing files against each other.


## Sometime

Re-read Mandlebrot example from Chapter 2 with fresh eyes to see how much
more I understand now - and with a view to eventually refactor to use a thread
pool and much smaller chunks of work (one row per thread invocation?).
